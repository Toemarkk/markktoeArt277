     <h1>What is Lorem lpsum?</h1>

          <p><strong>Lorem lpsum</strong> is simlply dummytextof the printing and typesettinf industry. <u> Lorem lpsum </u>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since 1500s, when an unknow printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. it has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remanining essentially unchange Lorem lpsum passage, and more recenrly with destop publishing software like <strong><em><u>Aldus Pagemaker</u><em></strong> including wersions of <u>Lorem lpsum.</u>1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p> 
<blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore magna aliqua. quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliqui ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Ecepteur sint occaecat cupidatta non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.</blockquote>
<h1> Why do we use it. </h1>
<p>it is it a long established fact that reader will be distracted by readable conetnt of a page when loking at its layout. The point of using <u>Lorem lpusm</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <q>conent here, content here</q> , marking it look like readable English. Many destop publishing packages and web editor now use Lorem lpsum as their defualt model text, and a search for <q>lorem lpsum</q> will uncover many web site still in their infancy. Various version have evolved over the years, somertimes on purpose (injucted humor and the like).</p>
<h1>Where can i get some?</h1>
<p><b>There are many variation of passages of Lorem lpsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injucted humour, or <u>randomized works</u> which donot look even silghtly believable</b>. If you are going to use a passage of Lorme lpsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. <i>All the Lorem lpsum generator on the internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</i> it uses a dictionary of over 200 latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generated Lorem lpsum is therefore always free from repetition, injucted humour, or non-characteristic word etc.</p>
