            Follow the guidelines to help protect yourself from contracting and transmitting SARS-CoV-2.
        <ol class="list">
            <li><h3>Wash your hands frequently and carefully</h3> 
            Use warm water and soap and rub your hands for at least 20 seconds. Work the lather to your wrists,
            between your fingers, and under your fingernails. You can also use an antibacterial and antiviral soap.<br/>

            Use hand sanitizer when you cannot wash your hands properly. Rewash your hands several times a day,
            especially after touching anything, including your phone or laptop.
        </li>
        <li><h3> Avoid touching your face</h3>
            SARS-CoV-2 can live on some surfaces for up to 72 hours. You can get the virus on your hands if you
            touch a surface like:
            <ul>
                <li>gas pump handle</li>
                <li>your cell phone</li>
                <li>a doorknob</li>
            </ul>
            Avoid touching any part of your face or head, including your mouth, nose, and eyes. Also avoid biting
            your fingernails. This can give SARS-CoV-2 a chance to go from your hands into your body.

            <li><h3> Stop shaking hands and hugging people — for now</h3>
                Similarly, avoid touching other people. Skin-to-skin contact can transmit SARS-CoV-2 from one person
                to another.
                </li>
<li><h3>4. Don’t share personal items</h3>
    Do not share personal items like:
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>phone </li>
        <li>makeup</li>
        <li>combs</li>
    </ul>
    It’s also important not to share eating utensils and straws. Teach children to recognize their reusable
    cup, straw, and other dishes for their own use only.
</li>
